# Dragon's Legacy

Welcome to our task management web application which has a dragon based theme. This website is created for company usage only, we don't provide a web app for personal usage (yet). This project is made for a university class, hence we have some minimal requirements, but we want to add so much more than those to our web app.

Two important abbreviations, which we use throughout this README are: 

MVP = Minimum viable product, meaning that that specific component is required by our teacher.
NTH = Nice to have, meaning that we want to add this extra feature.

Now, we'll explain the entities one by one, specifying what is required and what we want to add besides that.

## Achievements

- NTH:
    - [ ] when the user reaches some important milestones he will receive and achievement
    - [ ] each achievement will give the user coins and experience points
